            <p>CI/CD, which stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment, aims to streamline and accelerate the software development lifecycle. Continuous integration (CI) refers to the practice of automatically and frequently integrating code changes into a shared source code repository.
              What are the stages of a CI/CD pipeline? The CI/CD pipeline combines continuous integration, delivery and deployment into four major phases: source, build, test and deploy. Each phase uses highly detailed processes, standards, tools and automation 
              To ensure that your organisation is well-positioned for success in CI/OpEx deployment, you should consider five essential components:
  Culture change.
  Process improvement.
  Technology enablement.
  Organisational capability building.
  Stakeholder engagement.
